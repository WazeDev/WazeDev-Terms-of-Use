WazeDev - Terms of Use
----------

*Revision 2, 5/11/2018*

*These terms apply to the use of the WazeDev organization on GitHub.  This document must be stored in a location under WazeDev that is accessible to view by all members and non-members.  Updates to this document must be done according to the procedure listed in the Organization Owners section.*

----------

### Intent of the Organization

The WazeDev organization is intended to host scripts and any other tools that assist Waze map editors with the tasks involved in map editing, according to the rules and guidelines set forth by Waze staff and community Champs.  In the event the author is no longer able or willing to maintain a script, he or she can be assured it will continue to be updated and improved for as long as the script is useful to editors.

### Organization Owners

By accepting an **Organization Owner** role, you agree to the terms in this section.

1. You must send a link to this document to anyone you add as a member or owner of this organization.

2. You may not perform any actions on a repository that the Repository Admins can perform themselves, except in the following cases:
	* **No response is received from any Repository Admin for a period of at least 30 days from the date of the first attempted contact with no response.** Organization Owners may *only* assign a single Interim Repository Admin.  At least three Organization Owners must agree on the Interim Repository Admin before that person is assigned the Admin role for the repository.

	* **All Repository Admin(s) agree to turn the repository over to the care of the Organization Owners.** Organization Owners may *only* assign a single Interim Repository Admin.  At least three Organization Owners must agree on the Interim Repository Admin before that person is assigned the Admin role for the repository.

	* **The Organization Owners unanimously agree some or all content within a repo does not meet the intent of the WazeDev organization.** See the Repository Admins section for details of allowed actions.
	
3. Before performing any actions on a repository that the Repository Admins cannot perform themselves, you must obtain approval from all Repository Admins.

4. You may not add additional Organization Owners if there are already five (5).

5. If there are fewer Organization Owners than the number listed above at any time, the remaining Organization Owner(s) must, as soon as possible, vote on new owners to bring the total to the number listed above.  In the event of a tie, an online coin flip may be used.

6. You may only remove or change the role of another Organization Owner under the following circumstances:
	* **There is clear evidence of at least one intentional violation of these terms.**  The remaining Organization Owners must unanimously agree on the role change.

	* **The Organization Owner cannot be contacted for a period of at least 30 days.**  The remaining Organization Owners must unanimously agree on the role change.

	* **The Organization Owner requests it.**

7. You agree that any updates to this document must be approved by all Organization Owners and a summary of the changes sent to all Repository Admins and Interim Repository Admins.  Under no circumstances may you remove the right of any Repository Admin to have the Admin role on their own repository(s), or to otherwise change their repository privileges.

### Repository Admins

By accepting a **Repository Admin** role, you agree to the terms in this section.

1. You agree that in the event the Organization Owners unanimously determine that any content in the repository does not meet the intent of the organization, and should therefore not be hosted in WazeDev, you will do one of the following within 3 days of being notified:
	* Delete any offending content specified by the Organization Owners.

	* Move the repository to a personal GitHub account or to a different organization.

	* Delete the entire repository. 

	If the content remains after 3 days, the Organization Owners may push a commit to temporarily wipe the content of the repository.  You may still move the repo off of WazeDev and revert the commit to restore the content.

2. You agree that Organization Owners may assign an Interim Repository Admin in the event that no Repository Admin can be contacted via any of the standard Waze community communication methods (e.g. forum direct message, Google Hangout, Slack) for a period of at least 30 days.  However, you may resume your Repository Admin role at any time.

3. As an Admin, you have complete control over the repository.  It is up to you individually or as a team to decide who should have access, what level of access they should have, how to handle any disagreements, etc.

4. It is not the responsibility of Organization Owners to settle disputes and they will not remove or add admins when at least one admin is active, under any circumstances.  For that reason it is recommended, but not required, that only one Admin be assigned per repository.

### Interim Repository Admins

By accepting an **Interim Repository Admin** role, you agree to the terms in this section.

1. You agree to the same terms as a Repository Admin with the following exceptions:

    * **You must relinquish your Admin role to any of the original Repository Admins if they request it.**

    * **You agree to preserve the original author’s name(s) and license in any script headers, if present.**  It is acceptable to add additional names to the author list after the original author’s name(s).

    * **You may not delete the repository.**  If it is determined the code in the repository needs to be decommissioned, you must find an alternate method to do so.  For example, you may overwrite with a blank script template as long as the original code is still available in the commit history should the original author wish to retrieve it.

2. Intentional violation of these terms may be grounds for removal of your Interim Repository Admin status, pending a unanimous vote of the Organization Owners.

### Organization Members

Organization Members without Admin or Owner roles have no specific rights granted or denied by this document.
